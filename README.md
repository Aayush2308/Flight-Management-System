About project-
The Flight Management System (FMS) is a sophisticated application designed to streamline airline operations and 
empower aviation personnel in managing flight-related activities with precision and efficiency. Developed using 
Java Swing for the user interface and MySQL for robust database management, FMS offers a comprehensive 
suite of features tailored to flight scheduling, resource allocation, and operational oversight. Through FMS, 
administrators can manage multiple flights. Detailed records of flights include essential information such 
as departure and arrival times, aircraft type, crew assignments, and passenger manifests, ensuring a granular 
understanding of each flight's operation.
